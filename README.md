# Arena-Simulation-of-an-Airport-Check-In-Process-
## Project Overview
This project simulates the check-in process for 3 gates at an airport using Arena Simulation Software. The purpose of this simulation is to model and analyze the efficiency of the check-in process, identify potential bottlenecks, and explore ways to optimize the system for better performance.
## Features
* Modeling of Airport Check-In Process: The simulation models the entire check-in process, including passenger arrival, queueing, check-in, security checks, baggage weighing, and passenger profiling.
* Multiple Scenarios: The project allows for the simulation of different scenarios, such as varying the number of check-in counters, changing passenger arrival rates, and more.
* Performance Metrics: The simulation tracks key performance metrics such as average waiting time, queue lengths, and resource utilization.
## Simulation Details
* Entities: Passengers arriving at the airport.
* Processes: Security check, remedation, baggage weighing, passenger profiling, Boarding pass.
* Resources: Check-in counters, security personnel.
* Performance Metrics: The simulation measures average waiting time, queue length, and resource utilization.
## Results
The results of the simulation are detailed in the accompanying PowerPoint presentation. The presentation includes insights into the efficiency of the check-in process and provides recommendations for optimizing the system. Key recommendations focus on improving resource utilization, reducing queue lengths, and minimizing average waiting times.
