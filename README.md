# Arena-Simulation-of-an-Airport-Check-In-Process-
## Project Overview
This project simulates the check-in process at an airport using Arena Simulation Software. The purpose of this simulation is to model and analyze the efficiency of the check-in process, identify potential bottlenecks, and explore ways to optimize the system for better performance.
## Features
* Modeling of Airport Check-In Process: The simulation models the entire check-in process, including passenger arrival, queueing, check-in, and security checks.
* Multiple Scenarios: The project allows for the simulation of different scenarios, such as varying the number of check-in counters, changing passenger arrival rates, and more.
* Performance Metrics: The simulation tracks key performance metrics such as average waiting time, queue lengths, and resource utilization.
